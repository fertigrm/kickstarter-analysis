## Kickstarting with Excel

## In this project we analyzed the data to extrapolate two different sets of data,
the number of successful plays and their respective months of funding, as well as 
finding out the success rate of plays based on their crowd funding goal.

### The purpose of this was to find useful insights for Louise, so we can help her
with her project

## Some challenges where making sure that every command was entered correctly, down to
the digit, I had to backtrack and add '=' to signs in my < or >
 countif sections to correct my graph.

## Results
- Based on the data we can determine that the best time of year for crowd funding a
plays is Early June. We can also determine the worst time to crowd fund a play starts in
September with a steep decline all the way until January and peaking in early June

- From analyzing outcomes based on thier goal crowd funding amount we can determine that
plays looking for less than $1k have the highest success rate, while plays looking for
more than $15k fail more often than not.

- Some limitations in this data set are 0 canceled plays

- Another table we could make is examining the type of play that gets funded vs the type of play
that doesnt meet its fundraising goal, we could also add another filter to the data set based on country
